      <p>
        I'm Serofer, currently providing service in the
        <a href="https://www.vtg.admin.ch/de/home.html">Swiss Army</a> as a
        Strategic Radio Explorerüî≠. During my time on my disposal, I'm coding
        and working on my projectsüöÄ. <br />
        When not working on my projects, you will probably find me on the
        footballpitch‚öΩ. It is my second passion after coding and developing
        sustainable tech projects.

      <h2>Education</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        I was 6 years in the highschool
        <a href="https://www.ksobwalden.ch/">Kantonsschule Obwalden</a>. I did
        the Matura deepened in the major subject physics and applications of
        mathematics and the minor subject informatics.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h2>Tech Stack and Coding Experience</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        My first coding experience was at the age of 14 when I was invited to a
        coding camp from the <a href="">Swiss Olympiad in Informatics</a> after
        wining the informatics competition <em>Informatikbieber</em>. There I
        got the first time in touch with algorithms, loops, if-statements and
        graphs in the lovely programming language <em>Python</em>üêç. Due to not
        having an own laptop or computer, I couldn't really continue my coding
        journey until I was 17 years old. At this age, I wrote my paper for the
        Matura in which I programmed a video game to train the working memory.
        Therefore I used <em>Unity</em> and <em>C#</em>. During my work, I found
        my passion for coding and becane hungry for more. After graduation, I
        tried multiple tools and languages to find my favourite ones. I worked
        on Web Development with <em>JavaScript, HTML, CSS</em> and
        <em>Bootstrap</em>. I programmed a Memory Game with multiple modes and
        features using <em>Java</em>. I used <em>Pygame</em> to develop a game
        and of course I tried frameworks and libraries like Tone.js, JFrame and
        Flask.
      </p>

      <h2>Future</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        I'm looking forward to work on many new and cool projects during my time
        between the Army and the start uf University. I'll work with my
        Raspberry Pi going into AI woth PyTorch. After that break, I'll study
        electrical engineer at the ETH.
